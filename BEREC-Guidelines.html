<p>BoR (16) 127</p>
<h1 id="background-and-general-aspects">Background and general aspects</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>These BEREC Guidelines drafted in accordance with Article 5(3) of the Regulation <a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> are designed to provide guidance on the implementation of the obligations of NRAs. Specifically, this includes the obligations to closely monitor and ensure compliance with the rules to safeguard equal and non-discriminatory treatment of traffic in the provision of internet access services and related end-users rights as laid down in Articles 3 and 4. These Guidelines constitute recommendations to NRAs, and NRAs should take utmost account of the Guidelines.<a href="#note2" id="note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a> The Guidelines should contribute to the consistent application of the Regulation, thereby contributing to regulatory certainty for stakeholders.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For the purpose of these Guidelines, BEREC has used the following terms throughout the Guidelines to improve readability.<a href="#note3" id="note3ref"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Application: In these Guidelines, BEREC use the term “application” as a short expression for more lengthy expressions from the Regulation, like “applications and services”, “content, application and service”.</p>
<p>CAP: (Content CAPs make content (e.g. web pages, blogs, video) and/or applications and Application (e.g. search engines, VoIP applications) and/or services available on the Provider) Internet. CAPs may also make content, services and applications available via specialised services.</p>
<p>ISP: (Internet In these Guidelines, BEREC uses the term “ISP” to refer to providers of Service internet access services (IAS). ISPs may also be providers of Provider) specialised services.</p>
<p>Specialised service: In these Guidelines, BEREC uses the term “specialised services” as a short expression for “services other than internet access services which are optimised for specific content, applications or services, or a combination thereof, where the optimisation is necessary in order to meet requirements of the content, applications or services for a specific level of quality” (ref. Article 3(5)).</p>
<h1 id="article-1-subject-matter-and-scope">Article 1 – Subject matter and scope</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>This Regulation establishes common rules to safeguard equal and non-discriminatory treatment of traffic in the provision of internet access services and related end-users’ rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="recital-1">Recital 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This Regulation aims to establish common rules to safeguard equal and non-discriminatory treatment of traffic in the provision of internet access services and related end-users’ rights. It aims to protect end-users and simultaneously to guarantee the continued functioning of the internet ecosystem as an engine of innovation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="recital-2">Recital 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The measures provided for in this Regulation respect the principle of technological neutrality, that is to say they neither impose nor discriminate in favour of the use of a particular type of technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="recital-3">Recital 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The internet has developed over the past decades as an open platform for innovation with low access barriers for end-users, providers of content, applications and services and providers of internet access services. The existing regulatory framework aims to promote the ability of end-users to access and distribute information or run applications and services of their choice. However, a significant number of end-users are affected by traffic management practices which block or slow down specific applications or services. Those tendencies require common rules at the Union level to ensure the openness of the internet and to avoid fragmentation of the internal market resulting from measures adopted by individual Member States.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Article 1 sets out the subject matter and scope of the Regulation, which is to establish common rules to safeguard “equal and non-discriminatory treatment of traffic in the provision of internet access services” and “related end-users’ rights”.</p></li>
<li><p>According to the Framework Directive,<a href="#note4" id="note4ref"><sup>4</sup></a> “end-user” means a user not providing public communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services. In turn, “user” means a legal entity or natural person using or requesting a publicly available electronic communications service. On that basis, BEREC understands “end-user” to encompass individuals and businesses, including consumers as well as CAPs.</p></li>
<li><p>CAPs are protected as end-users under the Regulation in so far as CAPs use an IAS to reach other end-users. However, some CAPs may also operate their own networks and, as part of that, have interconnection agreements with ISPs; the provision of interconnection is a distinct service from the provision of IAS.</p></li>
<li><p>NRAs may take into account the interconnection policies and practices of ISPs in so far as they have the effect of limiting the exercise of end-user rights under Article 3(1). For example, this may be relevant in some cases, such as if the interconnection is implemented in a way which seeks to circumvent the Regulation.&lt;<a href="#note5" id="note5ref">sup&gt;5</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="article-2-definitions">Article 2 – Definitions</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions set out in Article 2 of Directive 2002/21/EC apply. The following definitions also apply:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The definitions of Article 2 of Directive 2002/21/EC also apply for the purposes of these Guidelines. This includes the terms “end-user”, “consumer”, “electronic communications services”, “electronic communications network” and “network termination point (NTP)”.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="provider-of-electronic-communications-to-the-public">“Provider of electronic communications to the public”</h4>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>‘provider of electronic communications to the public’ means an undertaking providing public communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The term “provider of electronic communications to the public” (PECP) comprises both “public communications networks” and “electronic communications services” (ECS), which are defined in Article 2 of the Framework Directive.<a href="#note6" id="note6ref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Conversely, the definition of PECP does not cover providers of electronic communication services or communication networks that are not publicly available, which are therefore out of scope of this Regulation.</p></li>
<li><p>Electronic communication services or networks that are offered not only to a predetermined group of end-users but in principle to any customer who wants to subscribe to the service or network should be considered to be publicly available. Electronic communication services or networks that are offered only to a predetermined group of end-users could be considered to be not publicly available.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual private network (VPN) services are typically offered by PECPs to anyone that wishes to enter a contract about the provision of such a service. These would therefore typically be considered to be publicly available, although the operation of a specific VPN would be a private network. The term ‘private’ describes the use of such a service which is usually limited to endpoints of the business entering the contract and is secured for internal communications. VPNs are further discussed in paragraph 115.</p></li>
<li><p>The following examples could be considered as services or networks not being made publicly available, subject to a case-by-case assessment by NRAs taking into account national practices:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>access to the internet provided by cafés and restaurants;</li>
<li>internal corporate networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of criteria which could be used to make assessments include the contractual relationship under which the service is provided, the range of users and whether the range is predetermined.</p>
<h4 id="internet-access-service">“Internet access service”</h4>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>‘internet access service’ means a publicly available electronic communications service that provides access to the internet, and thereby connectivity to virtually all end points of the internet, irrespective of the network technology and terminal equipment used.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="recital-4">Recital 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>An internet access service provides access to the internet, and in principle to all the end-points thereof, irrespective of the network technology and terminal equipment used by end-users. However, for reasons outside the control of providers of internet access services, certain end points of the internet may not always be accessible. Therefore, such providers should be deemed to have complied with their obligations related to the provision of an internet access service within the meaning of this Regulation when that service provides connectivity to virtually all end points of the internet. Providers of internet access services should therefore not restrict connectivity to any accessible end-points of the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="13" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Article 2(2) defines an “internet access service” (IAS) as an ECS that provides access to the internet, and thereby connectivity to virtually all end points of the internet, irrespective of the network technology and terminal equipment used.</p></li>
<li><p>For the purpose of the Regulation, BEREC understands the term “internet” as referring to a global system of interconnected networks that enables connected end-users to connect to one another. An IAS enables such access to the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>BEREC understands the term “connectivity to virtually all end-points” as a consequence of the fact that the internet is a distributed system where a single ISP controls a rather limited part. Due to reasons outside the control of an individual ISP (e.g. technical limitations, the policy of other ISPs or regulation in some countries), not all endpoints might be reachable all of the time. However, such a lack of reachability should not preclude that the service is defined as an IAS.</p></li>
<li><p>Where restrictions to reach end-points stem from the use of two different internet addressing schemes, IPv4 and IPv6, this typically does not mean the services cannot be defined as an IAS. While it is not possible to connect two different points with different types of addresses without any translation function, BEREC considers that the term “virtually all end points” should, at present, not be interpreted as a requirement on ISPs to offer connectivity with both IPv4 and IPv6.</p></li>
<li><p>BEREC understands a sub-internet service to be a service which restricts access to services or applications (e.g. banning the use of VoIP or video streaming) or enables access to only a pre-defined part of the internet (e.g. access only to particular websites). NRAs should take into account the fact that an ISP could easily circumvent the Regulation by providing such sub-internet offers. These services should therefore be considered to be in the scope of the Regulation and the fact that they provide a limited access to the internet should constitute an infringement of Articles 3(1), 3(2) and 3(3) of the Regulation. BEREC refers to these service offers as ‘sub-internet services’, as further discussed in paragraphs 38 and 55.</p></li>
<li><p>Services where the number of reachable end-points is limited by the nature of the terminal equipment used with such services (e.g. services designed for communication with individual devices, such as e-book readers as well as machine-to-machine<a href="#note7" id="note7ref"><sup>7</sup></a> devices like smart meters etc.) are considered to be outside the scope of the Regulation unless they are used to circumvent this Regulation. They could use an IAS (but not provide an IAS nor constitute a substitute to an IAS), use a private network or constitute a specialised service. If these services are using an IAS or constitute a specialised service the connectivity service will be subject to the relevant rules applicable to IAS and specialised services in the Regulation.<a href="#note8" id="note8ref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="article-3-safeguarding-of-open-internet-access">Article 3 – Safeguarding of open internet access</h1>
<ol start="19" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Article 3 comprises measures intended to safeguard open internet access, covering the rights of the end-users of IAS, and obligations and permitted practices for the ISPs:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Article 3(1) sets out the rights of end-users of IAS;</li>
<li>Article 3(2) sets limits on the contractual conditions which may be applied to IAS and the commercial practices of ISPs providing IAS, and requires that these should not limit exercise of the end-user rights set out in paragraph 1. When assessing commercial practices, Article 3(3) should also be taken into account;</li>
<li>Article 3(3) constrains ISPs’ traffic management practices, setting a requirement that ISPs should treat all data traffic equally and making provision for the specific circumstances under which ISPs may deviate from this rule;</li>
<li>Article 3(4) sets out the conditions under which traffic management measures may entail processing of personal data;</li>
<li>Article 3(5) sets out the freedom of ISPs and CAPs to provide specialised services as well as the conditions under which this freedom may be exercised.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="20" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The Regulation observes the fundamental rights of, and the principles recognised in, the Charter, notably the protection of personal data, the freedom of expression and information, the freedom to conduct a business, non-discrimination and consumer protection (ref. Recital 33).</p></li>
<li><p>BEREC considers that the Regulation does not require an ex ante authorisation in relation to commercial practices (Article 3(2)), traffic management practices (Article 3(3)) and specialised services (Article 3(5)). However, this should not preclude exchanges between NRAs and market players in relation to these issues, nor does it preclude NRAs from drawing on their obligations or powers to intervene under Article 5.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="article-31">Article 3(1)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>End-users shall have the right to access and distribute information and content, use and provide applications and services, and use terminal equipment of their choice, irrespective of the end-user’s or provider’s location or the location, origin or destination of the information, content, application or service, via their internet access service.</p>
<p>This paragraph is without prejudice to Union law, or national law that complies with Union law, related to the lawfulness of the content, applications or services.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="recital-5">Recital 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When accessing the internet, end-users should be free to choose between various types of terminal equipment as defined in Commission Directive 2008/63/EC (1). Providers of internet access services should not impose restrictions on the use of terminal equipment connecting to the network in addition to those imposed by manufacturers or distributors of terminal equipment in accordance with Union law.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="recital-6">Recital 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>End-users should have the right to access and distribute information and content, and to use and provide applications and services without discrimination, via their internet access service. The exercise of this right should be without prejudice to Union law, or national law that complies with Union law, regarding the lawfulness of content, applications or services. This Regulation does not seek to regulate the lawfulness of the content, applications or services, nor does it seek to regulate the procedures, requirements and safeguards related thereto. Those matters therefore remain subject to Union law, or national law that complies with Union law.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="22" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Article 3(1) sets out the end-users’ rights with regard to the open internet. The notion of end-user is explained in paragraph 4 of these Guidelines.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="access-and-distribute-information-and-content">Access and distribute information and content</h4>
<ol start="23" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Firstly, end-users have the right to access and distribute information and content. “Access and distribute” means that the provisions of this Regulation apply to both sending and receiving data over the IAS. “Information and content” is intended to cover any form of data that can be sent or received over the IAS.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="use-and-provide-applications-and-services">“Use and provide applications and services”</h4>
<ol start="24" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Secondly, end-users have the right to use and provide applications and services. “Use and provide” means that the right applies both to consumption and provision of applications and services. “Applications and services” means both applications (including client and server software) as well as services.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="use-terminal-equipment-of-their-choice">“Use terminal equipment of their choice”</h4>
<ol start="25" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Thirdly, end-users have the right to use terminal equipment of their choice. Directive 2008/63/EC defines “terminal equipment” as “equipment directly or indirectly connected to the interface of a public telecommunication network”. The right to choose terminal equipment therefore covers equipment which connects to the interface of the public telecommunications network. This interface, the network termination point (NTP), is defined in Article 2 (da) of the Framework Directive (2002/21/EC), meaning the physical point at which a subscriber is provided with access to a public communications network.</p></li>
<li><p>In considering whether end-users may use the terminal equipment of their choice, NRAs should assess whether an ISP provides equipment for its subscribers and restricts the end-users’ ability to replace that equipment with their own equipment, i.e. whether it provides “obligatory equipment”.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, NRAs should consider whether there is an objective technological necessity for the obligatory equipment to be considered as part of the ISP network. If there is not, and if the choice of terminal equipment is limited, the practice would be in conflict with the Regulation. For example, the practice of restricting tethering<a href="#note9" id="note9ref"><sup>9</sup></a> is likely to constitute a restriction on choice of terminal equipment because ISPs “should not impose restrictions on the use of terminal equipment connecting to the network in addition to those imposed by manufacturers or distributors of terminal equipment in accordance with Union law” (Recital 5).</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="legislation-related-to-the-lawfulness-of-the-content-applications-or-services">Legislation related to the lawfulness of the content, applications or services</h4>
<ol start="28" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Article 3(1) second subparagraph specifies that Union law, and national law that complies with Union law, related to the lawfulness of content, applications or services still applies. The TSM Regulation does not seek to regulate the lawfulness of the content, applications or services (ref. Recital 6).</p></li>
<li><p>Whereas Article 3(1) second subparagraph contains a clarification with regard to the applicability of such legislation, Article 3(3) (a) provides for an exception for ISPs to implement measures going beyond reasonable traffic management measures in order to comply with legislation or measures as specified in that exception.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="article-32">Article 3(2)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Agreements between providers of internet access services and end-users on commercial and technical conditions and the characteristics of internet access services such as price, data volumes or speed, and any commercial practices conducted by providers of internet access services, shall not limit the exercise of the rights of end-users laid down in paragraph 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="recital-7">Recital 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to exercise their rights to access and distribute information and content and to use and provide applications and services of their choice, end-users should be free to agree with providers of internet access services on tariffs for specific data volumes and speeds of the internet access service. Such agreements, as well as any commercial practices of providers of internet access services, should not limit the exercise of those rights and thus circumvent provisions of this Regulation safeguarding open internet access. National regulatory and other competent authorities should be empowered to intervene against agreements or commercial practices which, by reason of their scale, lead to situations where end-users’ choice is materially reduced in practice. To this end, the assessment of agreements and commercial practices should, inter alia, take into account the respective market positions of those providers of internet access services, and of the providers of content, applications and services, that are involved. National regulatory and other competent authorities should be required, as part of their monitoring and enforcement function, to intervene when agreements or commercial practices would result in the undermining of the essence of the end-users’ rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="30" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Article 3(2) clarifies that agreements between ISPs and end-users on commercial and technical conditions and the characteristics of IAS such as price, data volumes or speed, and any commercial practices conducted by ISPs are allowed, but shall not limit the exercise of the rights of end-users laid down in Article 3(1).</p></li>
<li><p>To BEREC’s understanding, Article 3(2) contains two relevant aspects:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>the freedom to conclude agreements between ISPs and end-users relating to commercial and technical conditions as well as characteristics of IAS;</p></li>
<li><p>the provision that such agreements and commercial practices shall not limit the exercise of the end-users’ rights laid down in Article 3(1).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="agreements-on-commercial-and-technical-conditions-and-the-characteristics-of-internet-access-services">Agreements on commercial and technical conditions and the characteristics of internet access services</h4>
<ol start="32" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Agreements refer to contractual relationships between ISPs and end-users that may include, as stated in the Regulation, commercial conditions (such as pricing), technical conditions (such as data volumes and speed) and any characteristics of the IAS. It should be noted that it will often be the case that commercial and technical conditions can be intertwined.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="commercial-practices">Commercial practices</h4>
<ol start="33" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Commercial practices may consist of all relevant aspects of ISPs’ commercial behaviour, including unilateral practices, of the ISP.<a href="#note10" id="note10ref"><sup>10</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="shall-not-limit-the-exercise-of-end-users-rights">Shall not limit the exercise of end-users’ rights</h4>
<ol start="34" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>With regard to characteristics of IAS, agreeing on tariffs for specific data volumes and speeds of the IAS would not represent a limitation of the exercise of the end-users’ rights (ref. Recital 7). Moreover, BEREC considers that end-users’ rights are likely to be unaffected, at least in the case that data volume and speed characteristics are applied in an application-agnostic way (applying equally to all applications).</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of commercial practices which are likely to be acceptable would include:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>application-agnostic offers where an end-user gets uncapped<a href="#note11" id="note11ref"><sup>11</sup></a> access to the internet (and not just for certain applications) during a limited period of time, e.g. during night-time or at weekends (when the network is less busy);</li>
<li>the ability for an end-user to access the ISP’s customer services when their data cap is reached in order to purchase access to additional data.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="36" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>An ISP may bundle the provision of the IAS with an application. For instance, a mobile operator may offer free subscription to a music streaming application for a period of time to all new subscribers (as opposed to commercial practices such as zero-rating, which is explained in paragraphs 40-43). Where the traffic associated with this application is not subject to any preferential traffic management practice, and is not priced differently than the transmission of the rest of the traffic, such commercial practices are deemed not to limit the exercise of the end-users’ rights granted under Article 3(1).</p></li>
<li><p>When assessing agreements or commercial practices, NRAs should also take Article 3(3) into account given that, typically, infringements of Article 3(3) (e.g. technical practices, such as blocking access to applications or types of applications) will limit the exercise of the end-users’ rights, and constitute an infringement of Articles 3(2) and 3(1). Details about this assessment can be found in paragraphs 49-93.</p></li>
<li><p>If an ISP contractually (as opposed to technically) banned the use of specific content, or one or more applications/services or categories thereof (for example, banning the use of VoIP) this would limit the exercise of the end-user rights set out in Article 3(1). This would be considered to be an offer of a sub-internet service (see paragraph 17).</p></li>
<li><p>However, some commercial conditions or practices, most obviously those involving price differentiation applied to categories of applications, are more likely to influence end-users’ exercise of the rights defined in Article 3(1) without necessarily limiting it.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a specific commercial practice called zero-rating. This is where an ISP applies a price of zero to the data traffic associated with a particular application or category of applications (and the data does not count towards any data cap in place on the IAS). There are different types of zero-rating practices which could have different effects on end-users and the open internet, and hence on the end-user rights protected under the Regulation.</p></li>
<li><p>A zero-rating offer where all applications are blocked (or slowed down) once the data cap is reached except for the zero-rated application(s) would infringe Article 3(3) first (and third) subparagraph (see paragraph 55).</p></li>
<li><p>The ISP could either apply or offer zero-rating to an entire category of applications (e.g. all video or all music streaming applications) or only to certain applications thereof (e.g. its own services, one specific social media application, the most popular video or music applications). In the latter case, an end-user is not prevented from using other music applications. However, the zero price applied to the data traffic of the zero-rated music application (and the fact that the data traffic of the zero-rated music application does not count towards any data cap in place on the IAS) creates an economic incentive to use that music application instead of competing ones. The effects of such a practice applied to a specific application are more likely to “undermine the essence of the end-users’ rights” or lead to circumstances where “end-users’ choice is materially reduced in practice” (Recital 7) than when it is applied to an entire category of applications.</p></li>
<li><p>When assessing such agreements or commercial practices like zero-rating in relation to Article 3(2), the assessment should take into account the aim of the Regulation to “safeguard equal and non-discriminatory treatment of traffic” (Article 1) and to “guarantee the continued functioning of the internet ecosystem as an engine of innovation” (Recital 1) as well as Recital 7, which directs intervention against agreements or commercial practices which, “by reason of their scale, lead to situations where end-users’ choice is materially reduced in practice”, or which would result in “the undermining of the essence of the end-users’ rights”.</p></li>
<li><p>Recital 7 also indicates that the assessment should take into account the “respective market positions of those providers of internet access services, and of the providers of content, applications and services, that are involved”.</p></li>
<li><p>When assessing whether an ISP limits the exercise of rights of end-users, NRAs should consider to what extent end-users’ choice is restricted by the agreed commercial and technical conditions or the commercial practices of the ISP. It is not the case that every factor affecting end-users’ choices should necessarily be considered to limit the exercise of end-users’ rights under Article 3(1). The Regulation also foresees intervention in case such restrictions result in choice being materially reduced, but also in other cases that could qualify as a limitation of the exercise of the end-users’ rights under Article 3(1).</p></li>
<li>In light of the aforementioned considerations, BEREC considers that a comprehensive assessment of such commercial and technical conditions may be required, taking into account in particular:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>the goals of the Regulation and whether the relevant agreements and/or commercial practices circumvent these general aims;</li>
<li>the market positions of the ISPs and CAPs involved - a limitation of the exercise of end-user rights is more likely to arise where an ISP or a CAP has a ‘strong’ market position (all else being equal) compared to a situation where the ISP or CAP has a ‘weak’ market position. The market positions should be analysed in line with competition law principles;</li>
<li>the effects on consumer and business customer end-user rights, which encompasses an assessment of inter alia:</li>
<li>whether there is an effect on the range and diversity of content and applications which consumer end-users may use<a href="#note122" id="note12ref"><sup>12</sup></a> and, if so, whether the range and diversity of applications which end-users can choose from is reduced in practice;</li>
<li>whether the end-user is incentivised to use, for example, certain applications;</li>
<li>whether the IAS subscription contains characteristics which materially reduce end-user choice (see in more detail in paragraph 48).</li>
<li><p>the effects on CAP end-user rights, which encompasses an assessment of, inter alia:</p></li>
<li>whether there is an effect on the range and diversity of content and applications which CAPs provide,<a href="#note13" id="note13ref"><sup>13</sup></a> and to what extent the range and diversity of applications may not be effectively accessed;</li>
<li>whether CAPs are materially discouraged from entering the market or forced to leave the market, or whether there are other material harms to competition in the market concerned (see in more detail in the fourth bullet of paragraph 48 with regard to offers);</li>
<li>whether the continued functioning of the internet ecosystem as an engine of innovation is impacted, for example, whether it is the ISP that picks winners and losers, and on the administrative and/or technical barriers for CAPs to enter into agreements with ISPs.</li>
<li><p>the scale of the practice and the presence of alternatives - a practice is more likely to limit the exercise of end-user rights in a situation where, for example, many end-users are concerned and/or there are few alternative offers and/or competing ISPs for the end-users to choose from.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="47" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Each of these factors may contribute to a material reduction in end-user choice and hence a limitation of the exercise of end-users’ rights under Article 3(2). In any specific case, the presence of one or more of these factors may in fact limit the exercise of end-user rights.</p></li>
<li>In applying such a comprehensive assessment, the following considerations may also be taken into account:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Any agreements or practices which have an effect similar to technical blocking of access (see paragraph 55) are likely to infringe Articles 3(1) and 3(2), given their strong impact on end-user rights.</li>
<li>Commercial practices which apply a higher price to the data associated with a specific application or class of applications are likely to limit the exercise of end-users’ rights because of the potentially strong disincentive created to the use of the application(s) affected, and consequent restriction of choice.

<blockquote>
<p>When providing internet access services, providers of those services should treat all traffic equally, without discrimination, restriction or interference, independently of its sender or receiver, content, application or service, or terminal equipment. According to general principles of Union law and settled case-law, comparable situations should not be treated differently and different situations should not be treated in the same way unless such treatment is objectively justified.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="49" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A basic principle of the Regulation relates to traffic management and is the obligation on ISPs to treat all traffic equally when providing IAS. Typically, infringements of this principle which are not justified according to Article 3(3) would also constitute an infringement of the end-user rights set out in Article 3(1).</p></li>
<li><p>As Article 3(3) concerns the equal treatment of all traffic “when providing internet access service”, the scope of this paragraph excludes IP interconnection practices.</p></li>
<li>In assessing whether an ISP complies with this principle, NRAs should apply a two-step assessment:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>In a first step, they should assess whether all traffic is treated equally.</p></li>
<li><p>In a second step, they should assess whether situations are comparable or different and whether there are objective grounds which could justify a different treatment of different situations (under Article 3(3) second subparagraph – see paragraphs 57-75 below).</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="52" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Moreover, NRAs should ensure that traffic on an IAS is managed:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>“without discrimination, restriction or interference”;</li>
<li>“irrespective of the sender and receiver, the content accessed or distributed, the applications or services used or provided, or the terminal equipment used”.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="53" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>NRAs should take into account that equal treatment does not necessarily imply that all end-users will experience the same network performance or quality of service (QoS). Thus, even though packets can experience varying transmission performance (e.g. on parameters such as latency or jitter), packets can normally be considered to be treated equally as long as all packets are processed agnostic to sender and receiver, to the content accessed or distributed, and to the application or service used or provided.</p></li>
<li><p>Endpoint-based congestion control<a href="#note14" id="note14ref"><sup>14</sup></a> (a typical example is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control) does not contravene Article 3(3) first subparagraph since, by definition, it takes place within terminal equipment and terminal equipment is not covered by the Regulation.<a href="#note15" id="note15ref"><sup>15</sup></a> NRAs should consider network-internal mechanisms of ISPs which assist endpoint-based congestion control<a href="#note16" id="note16ref"><sup>16</sup></a> to be in line with equal treatment, and therefore permissible, as long as these network-internal mechanisms are agnostic to the applications running in the endpoints and a circumvention of the Regulation does not take place.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of agreements or practices involving technical discrimination, this would constitute unequal treatment which would not be compatible with Article 3(3). This holds in particular for the following examples:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>A practice where an ISP blocks, slows down, restricts, interferes with, degrades or discriminates access to specific content, one or more applications (or categories thereof), except when justified by reference to the exceptions of Article 3(3) third subparagraph.</p></li>
<li><p>IAS offers where access to the internet is restricted to a limited set of applications or endpoints by the end-user’s ISP (sub-internet service offers) infringe upon Article 3(3) first subparagraph, as such offers entail blocking of applications and / or discrimination, restriction or interference related to the origin or destination of the information.</p></li>
<li><p>A zero-rating offer where all applications are blocked (or slowed down) once the data cap is reached except for the zero-rated application(s), as it would infringe Article 3(3) first (and third) subparagraph.</p></li>

<li><p>Under Article 3(3), NRAs should require ISPs to provide transparent information about traffic management practices and the impact of these practices (see also Articles 4 and 5).</p></li>
<li><p>When considering whether a traffic management measure is non-discriminatory, NRAs should consider the following:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>The requirement for traffic management measures to be non-discriminatory does not preclude ISPs from implementing - in order to optimise the overall transmission quality and user experience - traffic management measures which differentiate between objectively different categories of traffic (ref.

</ul>
<ol start="61" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When considering whether a traffic management measure is proportionate, NRAs should consider the following:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There has to be a legitimate aim for this measure, as specified in the first sentence of Recital 9, namely contributing to an efficient use of network resources and to an optimisation of overall transmission quality;</li>
<li><p>The traffic management measure has to be suitable to achieve this aim (with a requirement of evidence to show it has that effect and that it is not manifestly inappropriate);</p></li>
<li><p>The traffic management measure has to be necessary to achieve this aim;</p></li>
<li>There is not a less interfering and equally effective alternative way of managing traffic to achieve this aim (e.g. equal treatment without categories of traffic) with the available network resources;</li>

<ol start="62" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In assessing whether a traffic management measure is reasonable, NRAs should assess the justification put forward by the ISP. In order to be considered to be reasonable, a traffic management measure has to be based on objectively different technical QoS requirements of specific categories of traffic. Examples for technical QoS requirements are latency, jitter, packet loss, and bandwidth.</p></li>
<li><p>Traffic categories should typically be defined based on QoS requirements, whereby a traffic category will contain a flow of packets from applications with similar requirements. Therefore, if ISPs implement different technical QoS requirements of specific categories of traffic, this should be done objectively by basing them on the sensitivity to QoS requirements of the applications (e.g. latency, jitter, packet loss, and bandwidth). For example, such a category may consist of real-time applications requiring a short time delay between sender and receiver.<a href="#note18" id="note18ref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, as explained in Recital 9, ISPs’ traffic management measures are “responding to” the QoS requirements of the categories of traffic in order to optimise the overall transmission quality and enhance the user-experience. In order to identify categories of traffic, the ISP relies on the information provided by the application when packets are sent into the network. (See also paragraph 70 regarding which information can legitimately be considered by ISPs). Encrypted traffic should not be treated less favourably by reason of its encryption.</p></li>
<li><p>When NRAs consider network-internal mechanisms of ISPs which assist endpointbased congestion control (see paragraph 54) in the context of Article 3(3) second subparagraph, the queue management of the different traffic categories<a href="#note19" id="note19ref"><sup>19</sup></a> should be assessed under the same criteria as described in general for Article 3(3) second subparagraph.</p></li>
<li>Based on this, reasonable traffic management may be applied to differentiate between objectively different “categories of traffic”, for example by reference to an application layer protocol or generic application types (such as file sharing, VoIP or instant messaging), only in so far as:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>the application layer protocol or generic application types require objectively different technical QoS;</p></li>
<li><p>applications with equivalent QoS requirements are handled agnostically in the same traffic category; and</p></li>
<li><p>justifications are specific to the objectives that are pursued by implementing traffic management measures based on different categories of traffic.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="67" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>ISPs may prioritise network management and control traffic over the rest of their traffic. Such traffic management practices should be considered as reasonable, provided that they are transparent and are aimed at properly configuring and securing the network and its equipment by efficiently balancing load, e.g. by reacting as fast as possible in case of congestion, failures, outages, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="not-based-on-commercial-considerations">“Not based on commercial considerations”</h4>
<ol start="68" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the event that traffic management measures are based on commercial grounds, the traffic management measure is not reasonable. An obvious example of this could be where an ISP charges for usage of different traffic categories or where the traffic management measure reflects the commercial interests of an ISP that offers certain applications or partners with a provider of certain applications. However, NRAs do not need to prove that a traffic management measure is based on commercial grounds; it is sufficient to establish that the traffic management measure is not based on objectively different technical QoS requirements.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="shall-not-monitor-the-specific-content">“Shall not monitor the specific content”</h4>
<ol start="69" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In assessing traffic management measures, NRAs should ensure that such measures do not monitor the specific content (i.e. transport layer protocol payload).</p></li>
<li><p>Conversely, traffic management measures that monitor aspects other than the specific content, i.e. the generic content, should be deemed to be allowed. Monitoring techniques used by ISPs which rely on the information contained in the IP packet header, and transport layer protocol header (e.g. TCP) may be deemed to be generic content, as opposed to the specific content provided by end-users themselves (such as text, pictures and video).</p></li>

<li><p>This does not prevent, per se, a trigger function to be implemented and in place (but with the traffic management measure not yet effective) on an ongoing basis inasmuch as the traffic management measure only becomes effective in times of necessity. Necessity can materialise several times, or even regularly, over a given period of time.

<blockquote>
<p>Third, measures going beyond such reasonable traffic management measures might also be necessary to prevent impending network congestion, that is, situations where congestion is about to materialise, and to mitigate the effects of network congestion, where such congestion occurs only temporarily or in exceptional circumstances. The principle of proportionality requires that traffic management measures based on that exception treat equivalent categories of traffic equally. Temporary congestion should be understood as referring to specific situations of short duration, where a sudden increase in the number of users in addition to the regular users, or a sudden increase in demand for specific content, applications or services, may overflow the transmission capacity of some elements of the network and make the rest of the network less reactive. Temporary congestion might occur especially in mobile networks, which are subject to more variable conditions, such as physical obstructions, lower indoor coverage, or a variable number of active users with changing location. While it may be predictable that such temporary congestion might occur from time to time at certain points in the network – such that it cannot be regarded as exceptional – it might not recur so often or for such extensive periods that a capacity expansion would be economically justified. Exceptional congestion should be understood as referring to unpredictable and unavoidable situations of congestion, both in mobile and fixed networks. Possible causes of those situations include a technical failure such as a service outage due to broken cables or other infrastructure elements, unexpected changes in routing of traffic or large increases in network traffic due to emergency or other situations beyond the control of providers of internet access services. Such congestion problems are likely to be infrequent but may be severe, and are not necessarily of short duration. The need to apply traffic management measures going beyond the reasonable traffic management measures in order to prevent or mitigate the effects of temporary or exceptional network congestion should not give providers of internet access services the possibility to circumvent the general prohibition on blocking, slowing down, altering, restricting, interfering with, degrading or discriminating between specific content, applications or services, or specific categories thereof. Recurrent and more long-lasting network congestion which is neither exceptional nor temporary should not benefit from that exception but should rather be tackled through expansion of network capacity.</p>

<ol start="88" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In exceptional cases, and for no longer than necessary, ISPs may engage in traffic management beyond the limits of Article 3(3) second subparagraph to manage certain types of network congestion, namely impending network congestions (which may be prevented) and exceptional or temporary network congestions (the effects of which may be mitigated). Recital 15 provides detailed information on identifying situations where exceptional and temporary congestion occurs. Impending network congestion is defined as situations where congestion is about to materialise, i.e. it is imminent.</p></li>
<li><p>Recital 15 focuses on exceptional and temporary network congestion; thus, actions for preventing impending network congestion only apply to cases of such congestion.</p></li>
<li><p>When assessing congestion management exceptions under (c), NRAs should refer to the general criteria of strict interpretation and proportionality set out in Article 3(3) third subparagraph.

<li><p>Due to the requirement that exceptional traffic management can only be applied as necessary, and only for as long as necessary, NRAs should consider that in cases when application-agnostic congestion management (i.e. congestion management which is not targeting specific applications or categories thereof) is not sufficient, congestion can be dealt with according to Article 3(3) (c). Furthermore, in such cases, equivalent categories of traffic must be treated equally.

<p>There is demand on the part of providers of content, applications and services to be able to provide electronic communication services other than internet access services, for which specific levels of quality, that are not assured by internet access services, are necessary. Such specific levels of quality are, for instance, required by some services responding to a public interest or by some new machineto-machine communications services.

National regulatory authorities should verify whether and to what extent such optimisation is objectively necessary to ensure one or more specific and key features of the content, applications or services and to enable a corresponding quality assurance to be given to end-users, rather than simply granting general priority over comparable content, applications or services available via the internet access service and thereby circumventing the provisions regarding traffic management measures applicable to the internet access services.</p>

<li><p>NRAs should verify whether the application could be provided over IAS at the specific levels of quality which are objectively necessary in relation to the application, or whether they are instead set up in order to circumvent the provisions regarding traffic management measures applicable to IAS, which would not be allowed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Assessment according to Article 3(5) first subparagraph</em></p>
<ol start="106" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Initially, the requirement of an application can be specified by the provider of the specialised service, although requirements may also be inherent to the application itself. For example, a video application could use standard definition with a low bitrate or ultra-high definition with high bitrate, and these will obviously have different QoS requirements. A typical example of inherent requirements is low latency for real-time applications.</p></li>
<li><p>When assessing whether the practices used to provide specialised services comply with Article 3(5) first subparagraph, NRAs should apply the approach set out in paragraphs 108-115).</p></li>
<li><p>NRAs could request from the provider relevant information about their specialised services, using powers conferred by Article 5(2). In their responses, the provider should give information about their specialised services, including what the relevant QoS requirements are (e.g. latency, jitter and packet loss), and any contractual requirements. Furthermore, the “specific level of quality” should be specified, and it should be demonstrated that this specific level of quality cannot be assured over the IAS and that the QoS requirements are objectively necessary to ensure one or more key features of the application.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on this information, the NRA should assess the requirements mentioned in Article 3(5) first subparagraph.</p></li>
<li><p>If assurance of a specific level of quality is objectively necessary, this cannot be provided by simply granting general priority over comparable content.<a href="#note27" id="note27ref"><sup>27</sup></a> Specialised services do not provide connectivity to the internet and they can be offered, for example, through a connection that is logically separated from the traffic of the IAS in order to assure these levels of quality.</p></li>
<li><p>NRAs should verify whether, and to what extent, optimised delivery is objectively necessary to ensure one or more specific and key features of the applications, and to enable a corresponding quality assurance to be given to end-users. To do this, the NRA should assess whether an electronic communication service, other than IAS, requires a level of quality that cannot be assured over a IAS. If not, these electronic communication services are likely to circumvent the provisions of the Regulation and are therefore not allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>The internet and the nature of IAS will evolve over time. A service that is deemed to be a specialised service today may not necessarily qualify as a specialised service in the future due to the fact that the optimisation of the service may not be objectively necessary, as the general standard of IAS may have improved. On the other hand, additional services might emerge that need to be optimised, even as the standard of IAS improves. Given that we do not know what specialised services may emerge in the future, NRAs should assess whether a service qualifies as a specialised service on a case-by-case basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Typical examples of specialised services provided to end-users are VoLTE and linear broadcasting IPTV services with specific QoS requirements, subject to them meeting the requirements of the Regulation, in particular Article 3(5) first subparagraph. Under the same preconditions, other examples would include real-time health services (e.g. remote surgery) or “some services responding to a public interest or by some new machine-to-machine communications services” (Recital 16).</p></li>
<li><p>QoS might be especially important to corporate customers and these customers might be in need of specialised services which – as they are addressing businesses – are often referred to as “business services”. Such &quot;business services&quot; cover a wide array of services and have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p></li>
<li><p>VPNs could qualify as specialised services in accordance with Article 3(5) of the Regulation. However, in accordance with Recital 17, to the extent that corporate services such as VPNs also provide access to the internet, the provision of such access to the internet by a provider of electronic communications to the public should comply with Article 3(1) to (4) of the Regulation.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="article-35-second-subparagraph">Article 3(5) second subparagraph</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Providers of electronic communications to the public, including providers of internet access services, may offer or facilitate such services only if the network capacity is sufficient to provide them in addition to any internet access services provided. Such services shall not be usable or offered as a replacement for internet access services, and shall not be to the detriment of the availability or general quality of internet access services for end-users.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="recital-17">Recital 17</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to avoid the provision of such other services having a negative impact on the availability or general quality of internet access services for end-users, sufficient capacity needs to be ensured. Providers of electronic communications to the public, including providers of internet access services, should, therefore, offer such other services, or conclude corresponding agreements with providers of content, applications or services facilitating such other services, only if the network capacity is sufficient for their provision in addition to any internet access services provided. The provisions of this Regulation on the safeguarding of open internet access should not be circumvented by means of other services usable or offered as a replacement for internet access services. However, the mere fact that corporate services such as virtual private networks might also give access to the internet should not result in them being considered to be a replacement of the internet access services, provided that the provision of such access to the internet by a provider of electronic communications to the public complies with Article 3(1) to (4) of this Regulation, and therefore cannot be considered to be a circumvention of those provisions. The provision of such services other than internet access services should not be to the detriment of the availability and general quality of internet access services for end-users. In mobile networks, traffic volumes in a given radio cell are more difficult to anticipate due to the varying number of active end-users, and for this reason an impact on the quality of internet access services for end-users might occur in unforeseeable circumstances. In mobile networks, the general quality of internet access services for end-users should not be deemed to incur a detriment where the aggregate negative impact of services other than internet access services is unavoidable, minimal and limited to a short duration. National regulatory authorities should ensure that providers of electronic communications to the public comply with that requirement. In this respect, national regulatory authorities should assess the impact on the availability and general quality of internet access services by analysing, inter alia, quality of service parameters (such as latency, jitter, packet loss), the levels and effects of congestion in the network, actual versus advertised speeds, the performance of internet access services as compared with services other than internet access services, and quality as perceived by end-users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sufficient network capacity for specialised services in addition to IAS</em></p>
<ol start="116" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Specialised services shall only be offered when the network capacity is sufficient such that the IAS is not degraded (e.g. due to increased latency or jitter or lack of bandwidth) by the addition of specialised services. Both in the short and in the long term, specialised services shall not lead to a deterioration of the general IAS quality for end-users. This can, for example, be achieved by additional investments in infrastructure which allow for additional capacity so that there is no negative impact on IAS quality.</p></li>
<li><p>In a network with limited capacity, IAS and specialised services could compete for overall network resources. In order to safeguard the availability of general quality of IAS, the Regulation does not allow specialised services if the network capacity is not sufficient to provide them in addition to any IAS provided, because this would lead to degradation of the IAS and thereby circumvent the Regulation. It is the general quality of the IAS which is protected from degradation by the Regulation, rather than specialised services.</p></li>
<li><p>NRAs should assess whether, in order to ensure the quality of specialised services, ISPs have ensured sufficient network capacity for both any IAS offers provided over the infrastructure and for specialised services. If not, provision of specialised services would not be allowed under the Regulation.</p></li>
<li><p>NRAs could request information from ISPs regarding how sufficient capacity is ensured, and at which scale the service is offered (e.g. networks, coverage and end-users). NRAs could then assess how ISPs have estimated the additional capacity required for their specialised services and how they have ensured that network elements and connections have sufficient capacity available to provide specialised services in addition to any IAS provided.</p></li>
<li><p>NRAs should assess whether or not there is sufficient capacity for IAS when specialised services are provided, for example, by performing measurements of IAS.<a href="#note28" id="note28ref"><sup>28</sup></a> Methodologies for such measurements have been relatively well developed during BEREC’s Net Neutrality QoS workstreams in recent years and will continue to be improved.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>“Not to the detriment of the availability or general quality of IAS”</em></p>
<ol start="121" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Specialised services are not permissible if they are to the detriment of the availability and general quality of the IAS. There is a correlation between the performance of the IAS offer (i.e. its availability and general quality) and whether there is sufficient capacity to provide specialised services in addition to IAS. IAS quality measurements could be performed with and without specialised services, both in the short term for individual end-users (measuring with specialised services on and off respectively) and in the long term (which would include measurements before the specialised services are introduced in the market as well as after). As Recital 17 clarifies, NRAs should “assess the impact on the availability and general quality of IAS by analysing, inter alia, QoS parameters (such as latency, jitter and packet loss), the levels and effects of congestion in the network, actual versus advertised speeds and the performance of IAS as compared with services other than IAS”.</p></li>
<li><p>While IAS and specialised services directly compete for the dedicated part of an end-user’s capacity, the end-user himself may determine how to use it. When it is technically impossible to provide the specialised service in parallel to IAS without detriment to the end-user’s IAS quality, NRAs should not consider this competition for capacity to be an infringement of Article 3(5) second subparagraph, as long as the end-user is informed pursuant to Article 4(1)(c) of the impact on his IAS and can obtain the contractually-agreed speeds<a href="#note29" id="note29ref"><sup>29</sup></a> for any IAS subscribed to in parallel. NRAs should not consider it to be to the detriment of the general quality of IAS when activation of the specialised service by the individual end-user only affects his own IAS. However, detrimental effects should not occur in those parts of the network where capacity is shared between different end-users.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, as stated in Recital 17, in mobile networks - where the number of active users in a given cell, and consequently traffic volumes, are more difficult to anticipate than in fixed networks - the general quality of IAS for end-users should not be deemed to incur a detriment where the aggregate negative impact of specialised services is unavoidable, minimal and limited to a short duration. By contrast, such unforeseeable circumstances related to the number of users and traffic volumes should not normally occur in fixed networks.</p></li>
<li><p>NRAs could assess whether the provision of specialised services reduces general IAS quality by lowering measured download or upload speeds or, for example, by increasing delay, delay variation or packet loss. Normal small-scale temporal network fluctuation should not be considered to be to the detriment of the general quality. Network outages and other temporary problems caused by network faults, for example, should be treated separately.</p></li>
<li><p>NRAs should intervene if persistent decreases in performance are detected for IAS. This could be detected if the measured performance is consistently above (for metrics such as latency, jitter or packet loss) or below (for metrics such as speed) a previously detected average level for a relatively long period of time such as hours or days), or if the difference between measurement results before and after the specialised service is introduced is statistically significant. In the case of short-term assessments, the difference between measurement results with and without the specialised service should be assessed similarly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>“Not be usable or offered as a replacement for IAS”</em></p>
<ol start="126" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It is of utmost importance that the provisions regarding specialised services do not serve as a potential circumvention of the Regulation. Therefore, NRAs should assess whether a specialised service is a potential substitute for the IAS, and if the capacity needed for their provision is to the detriment of the capacity available for IAS.</p></li>
<li><p>In deciding whether a specialised service is considered as a replacement for an IAS, one important aspect that NRAs should assess is whether the service is actually providing access to the internet but in a restricted way, at a higher quality, or with differentiated traffic management. If so, this would be considered a circumvention of the Regulation.</p></li>

Those provisions should apply in addition to the applicable provisions of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) and Member States should have the possibility to maintain or adopt more far- reaching measures. Providers of internet access services should inform end-users in a clear manner how traffic management practices deployed might have an impact on the quality of internet access services, end-users’ privacy and the protection of personal data as well as about the possible impact of services other than internet access services to which they subscribe, on the quality and availability of their respective internet access services. In order to empower end-users in such situations, providers of internet access services should therefore inform end-users in the contract of the speed which they are able realistically to deliver. The normally available speed is understood to be the speed that an end-user could expect to receive most of the time when accessing the service. Providers of internet access services should also inform consumers of available remedies in accordance with national law in the event of noncompliance of performance. Any significant and continuous or regularly recurring difference, where established by a monitoring mechanism certified by the national regulatory authority, between the actual performance of the service and the performance indicated in the contract should be deemed to constitute non- conformity of performance for the purposes of determining the remedies available to the consumer in accordance with national law. The methodology should be established in the guidelines of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect technology and infrastructure evolution.

<li>Article 10(3) is addressed to Member States. However, when assessing compliance with Article 3(2) and (3), NRAs should take into account that national measures, including self-regulatory schemes, might benefit from a transitional period until 31 December 2016 when they may be maintained, provided that they were in place before 29 November 2015 and have been notified by the respective Member State to the Commission by 30 April 2016. In that event, no breach of Article 3(2) and Article 3(3) would be found during this transitional period.</li>

Recital 16 and paragraph 113 of these Guidelines). Moreover, a provider of an M2M device or M2M service (e.g. car manufacturer, provider of energy including smart meter) typically does not seem to provide an ECS under the present regulatory framework, whereas the connectivity service provider which provides connectivity over a public network for remuneration is generally the provider of an ECS in the IoT value chain (ref. BEREC Report on Enabling the Internet of Things, BoR (16) 39, pages 21-23).</p>

<p><a id="note10" href="#note10ref">10.</a> NRAs should also consider whether the definition of “commercial practices” in Article 2(d) the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD) could also provide guidance in understanding the term, ref. “any acts, omission, course of conduct or representation, commercial communication, including advertising and marketing, by a trader, directly connected with a promotion, sale or supply of a product”, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:149:0022:0039:EN:PDF. However, it should also be noted that the goal of the UCPD is different from the goal of Regulation 2015/2120 in as much as the former mainly addresses commercial practices which are directly connected with a promotion, sale or supply of a product (i.e. mainly advertising and marketing) whereas the latter establishes common rules to safeguard equal and non-discriminatory treatment of traffic in the provision of internet access services and related end-users’ rights.</p>
